Today my bike had its post-purchase, free service from [John's Bikes](http://www.johnsbikes.co.uk). I'd taken in a list of things that I wanted them to specifically check as well as a rear rack I wanted fitting which I'd bought so that I can use panniers and actually run some errands on the bike.

A couple of hours later the work was all done and the niggling issues I'd had were all sorted out. Gear changing is now much smoother and the chain doesn't occasionally drop off the smallest front ring when I change onto it so tackling a hill no longer includes the gamble as to whether I have to jump off and get oily fingers as an added bonus. The brakes feel tighter and overall the bike feels better than it did when I first collected it.

Fingers crossed that the good weather now lasts for a while so I can really enjoy the stunning Somerset countryside.
