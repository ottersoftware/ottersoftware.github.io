## The FOLC Project
I live in a small village in the middle of Somerset. In the village we have a church and although the current building dates from around 1500 the original church was constructed around 1350. The bell tower is nearly 100 feet tall, it has a faceless clock and six bells, five of which date from around 1750.

Whilst the church is in regular use it needs some substantial work doing to it which will cost around Â£500,000. Much of this relates to the roof and the work has added complexity because the building is [Grade I listed](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1058345).

To fund and manage the work, a charitable organisation called Friends of Leigh Church (FOLC) was formed with the goal of raising enough money not only to restore and repair the building but also to add a community space to it.

## The IT Project
One of the things FOLC want in the community space is a computer hosting an application which allows visitors to browse and search a database containing:

* Transcribed parish records of births, marriages and deaths.
* Scanned images of original pages from the parish records.
* Historical photographs or the parish which include buildings, people and places.
* Burial records based on legible gravestone transcriptions.
* Historical wills which have been transcribed.
* Geographical information such as locations of buildings, burial locations, etc. which can be displayed on maps.
* Scanned historical maps.


I was asked if my business would donate some time to create the system.

## The Blog Posts
I am going to blog about the process of creating the application. It will give me a record of what I have done and allow others to learn from my mistakes and victories and also see how software can be conceptualised, created, and how it evolves.
