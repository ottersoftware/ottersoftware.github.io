This is the blog of Simon Wolf, a single dad, occasional recreational cyclist, very amateur photographer and a Mac and iPhone developer by trade.

I run my own company, [Otter Software](http://www.ottersoftware.com), and I live England in the Mendips, a range of hills south of Bath.

You can find some of my photos on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) where I am [Simon G.A. Wolf](http://www.flickr.com/photos/91731286@N05/).

If you use any of my source code in your projects then please review the [license agreement](http://swwritings.com/licenseagreement) first.
