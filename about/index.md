My name is Simon Wolf. By day I am a Mac, iPhone and iPad developer but I am also a single parent, indoor rower and a very amateur photographer.

I run my own company, [Otter Software](http://www.ottersoftware.com), and I live in England in a small village in the Mendip Hills. My nearest town is [Frome](http://www.discoverfrome.co.uk/frome/), famed for its independent shops, great markets and [Festival](http://www.fromefestival.co.uk) amongst other things.

You can find me on Twitter as [@sgaw](https://twitter.com/sgaw).

Some of my apps are:

* An audio and video tagging system called [avTag](http://avtag.it).
* An inherrited payroll calculator called [iPAYE](http://www.ottersoftware.com/ipaye/index.html).
* The official [FromeFM](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fromefm/id948308814?mt=8) iOS app.

You can find my open-source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ottersoftware) but if you use any of my source code in your projects then please review the [license agreement](http://swwritings.com/licenseagreement) first.
