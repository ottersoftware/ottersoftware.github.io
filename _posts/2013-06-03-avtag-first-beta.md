Just over a month ago [I wrote a blog post](http://swwritings.com/post/2013-04-25-avtag-promise) about my intention to release a beta of avTag before WWDC. Today, one week before WWDC begins, I shipped beta 1 to 23 testers.

What people don't know is that a few days after making my commitment I also decided to make a more immediate, more terminal one during a discussion with another developer. That was that if I couldn't ship an alpha version to a very small group of people within a week I'd pull the plug on avTag.

The reasoning was that I'd been talking about avTag for over two years and I'd been developing it for around a year. If, after all of that time, I couldn't ship something that at least vaguely worked within a few days then I might as well not bother. The excuses, delays and procrastinating had to end and this was the final test.

With that in mind I created a long list of issues in [GitHub](https://github.com) and prioritised the ones I needed to fix to get something, anything, released. They included [implementing FTS](http://swwritings.com/post/2013-04-30-searching-for-speedy-searching) and merging in code from several, independent projects I'd created to try things out such as monitoring file changes in the application's Documents folder.

Over a three day period I spent something approaching 35 hours writing code and at the end of it I did indeed ship alpha 1 of avTag and in the four weeks since then I released a further 10 builds.

The strange thing is that my enthusiasm and excitement has, if anything, grown now that I can see it all coming together. There is still a lot to get done before I am ready to submit version 1 to Apple for approval but things have come a very long way in the last month, my enthusiasm is high, and a group of keen testers can only add to that.

After a lot of talk, avTag is nearly here.
