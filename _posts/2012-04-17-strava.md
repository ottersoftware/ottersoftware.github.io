A few days ago someone suggested [Strava](http://www.strava.com) to me as a way for me to track my rides. After a couple of days of using their iPhone app and web site I can see why. It's definitely worth checking out if you want to keep a log of your rides and also do things like compare your speed with that of other riders on segments of routes.

If you have a Strava account and want to follow my progress you can find me as athlete number [390099](http://app.strava.com/athletes/390099).
