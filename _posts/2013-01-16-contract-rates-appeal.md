title: Cocoa Contract Developer Rates - The Appeal

I recently tweeted about how I was upping my hourly rate after three years as a contract developer. Several people then asked me what I charged or how I had decided on what to charge. To be honest, mine is a bit of a finger in the air estimate of what I should be charging but I know a few developers who share their rates with me so I know I'm in vaguely the right area, albeit at the lower end.

I'd like to do a very informal survey to find out what other developers charge so that we can get a feel of what current rates are around the world.

If you'd like to help out then I'd be most grateful if you could answer the following questions for me:

1. Are you a sole developer or are you part of a larger company?
2. What is your current hourly rate? If you need to expand on that because you charge different rates for different things please do.
3. Where are you based?
4. Do you work on-site for your clients?
5. Do you mainly do iOS work, OS X work or a mix of both?
5. How are you finding the current contract market for Cocoa developers?
5. Anything else you want to add?

You can email replies to me via simon at ottersoftware dot com.

All answers will be treated in confidence and if you'd rather get a third party to pass on the information so that you remain anonymous then that's fine too.

I realise that this is a very sensitive area and that people don't generally like discussing their income but I think it would be interesting to see the range of rates charged.

I'll publish some completely anonymous information about the results in a few days once I've (hopefully) had a few replies.
