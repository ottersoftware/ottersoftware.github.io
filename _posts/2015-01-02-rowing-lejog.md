I generally try to avoid setting New Year's resolutions because I'm terrible at keeping to them and because it seems stupid to wait until a particular date before you implement a change in your life. However January 1 is a handy start date if you want to set yourself an annual challenge and that's what I've done this year.

My original plan was to follow in the footsteps of the inspirational [Jo Moseley](https://twitter.com/OneHappyRower) who rowed [one million metres in aid of Macmillan Cancer](https://www.justgiving.com/OneHappyRower/) during 2014. Setting myself a goal of rowing one million metres in 2015 is a big challenge but it is also manageable. A 5,000 metre row takes me around 25 minutes (at the moment) which is a reasonably amount of time to spend exercising each day. Doing that five days a week would amount to around 100,000 metres every four weeks and so the challenge should be complete some time in September which gives me some contingency time.

As an added bonus Jo and some other indoor rowers I know on Twitter proposed setting a #100kinjan rowing challenge which fit nicely into my plan and provides me with some additional moral support through my first month.

However I then wondered where 1,000,000 metres would take me so that I could put it into a geographical context for friends and relatives. It is like driving from London to Zurich or me driving from my house to John o'Groats.

It then occurred to me that it might be fun to undertake the equivalent of a famous cycling challenge, Land's End to John o'Groats (LEJOG), on an indoor rower. It is somewhere in the region of 1,400 to 1,500 km which is 50% more than I was originally planning on rowing this year and it might become my challenge for 2016 but I'm actually hoping that as I get fitter over the course of the year I might actually achieve the distance in 2015. Time will tell.

To make it more interesting I'm going to find a LEJOG route guide and then I can map my rows to that. It might take me four weeks to cover the distance a cyclist can do in a day but ticking off towns and villages will add some extra interest to the challenge and give it some additional perspective.
