### Introduction
* Chaos of paperwork
* Scotty's comments about my desk
* Xero
* Missing deadlines

### Cutting Out The Papers
* Only keep papers that really need to be kept, things such as legal documents.
* Scan everything else as soon as you can.
* Don't try to scan historic papers at first.
* Store the scanned documents in appropriate places as soon as you can.
* Stop printing things.
* Stop scribbing notes on bits of paper.

### Scanners
* Don't use a flatbed scanner.
* In early December Fraser Speirs tweeted about looking for and then buying a scanner. Got a Canon P-150 over a ScanSnap S1300 because it has TWAIN drivers available.
* Bought a Canon DR-2010M because a desktop scanner suits me fine.
* P-150 replaced by P-215.
* Can also consider the Fuji SnapScan scanners.
* Look out for M-versions. Mac software.
* Canon scanner comes with CaptureOnTouch.

### Making Notes
* More paper. Lots of bits.
* Mac, iPad and iPhone.
* Stylus - Wacom Bamboo
* Software - 
* One paper notebook.

### Stop Printing
* Instapaper, Kindle, Evernote.
* Second monitor or an iPad.

### Business Cards
* Don't give them out and don't accept them.
* Ask people to email you their details.
* Note their Twitter name and send them a message.
* iPhone app suggestions from the chat room.

### Storing Information
* Picking an application or applications.
* Evernote and OmniFocus.
* Backups

### Top Tips
* Backups.
* Create a routine of scanning and shredding papers.
* Find and stick with an application or applications.
* Remove Post-Its, pads, etc. Stop writing notes or at least use just one notebook.
* Take it slowly and don't expect on over-night change. Don't worry about the backlog for now.
