Earlier today [Matt Gemmell](https://twitter.com/mattgemmell) published a blog post entitled '[Releasing Outside the App Store](http://mattgemmell.com/2012/08/24/releasing-outside-the-app-store/)'. It's a great article and well worth a read but one particular section, 'Scary crypto and licensing', caught my eye. It is mainly about [CocoaFob](https://github.com/glebd/cocoafob/) by [Gleb Dolgich](https://twitter.com/glebd).

Essentially, if you need to implement your own licensing system into a Mac app and particularly if you use [FastSpring](http://fastspring.com/) or [Potion Store](http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore) as your storefront then this looks like a great alternative to [AquaticPrime](http://www.aquaticmac.com).
