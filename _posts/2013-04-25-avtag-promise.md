Just as the WWDC tickets went on sale and sold out [Mathew Waters asked me if avTag would be out before the WWDC videos come out](https://twitter.com/mathew_waters/status/327475269331992578). The quantity of WWDC videos and the problem with finding specific content in them again was the initial spark which made me devise the concept of avTag so I replied with a very rash decision. I made an even worse one since then.

[I said that it would be, at least as a beta.](https://twitter.com/sgaw/status/327476050437218304) I then expanded on that and said that regardless of the state of the UI (my designer of choice is horribly over-booked at the moment) and even if there were some rough edges and some peripheral functionality was missing it would happen.

Actually this wasn't a completely rash decision. I sometimes need deadlines and targets to get me to focus properly so I've publicly committed to one. I need to get avTag into the hands of beta testers and then actual customers so that I can get some feedback about it. I've flapped around for far too long.

So the final thing is that I need a consequence if I don't hit that deadline. This is where things get really dangerous. They don't know it yet but I'll be asking [Scotty](https://twitter.com/macdevnet) and [John Fox](https://twitter.com/djembe) to pick one and announce it on the next episode of [iDeveloper Live](http://ideveloper.tv/podcast/ideveloperlive.html). Feel free to make some suggestions to them too.

I'll post details of the one they choose here.
