Since publishing [my post about FTS](http://swwritings.com/post/2013-04-30-searching-for-speedy-searching) a few people have asked me which versions of iOS and OS X support FTS in the bundled version of SQLite. I can confirm that iOS 5.1 does and so does OS X 10.7.5.

Since I don't have a vast plethora of devices and OS X installs handy [I've created test projects](https://bitbucket.org/ottersoftware/fts-test/overview) for people to use for their own testing needs.

If you test earlier OS versions than those listed above and they do support FTS then please let me know.
