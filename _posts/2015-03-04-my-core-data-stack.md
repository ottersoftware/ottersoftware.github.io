Yesterday I retweeted a message by Serg Krivoblotsky ([@Krivoblotsky](https://twitter.com/Krivoblotsky)) which linked to a video of a talk Marcus Zarra ([@mzarra](https://twitter.com/mzarra)) gave at the [MCE 2015 conference](http://mceconf.com). The video was entitled 'Core Data: Multi-Threading Clarity' and you can [watch it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckbke8vjHMw).

One thing Marcus didn't do was go into actual code. His talk was about the higher-level theory. One of my followers asked if there was any code to go with it and since I'd not updated my Core Data stack setup code in a while I decided to revist it and write the code myself. The result is on GitHub in a repository called [CoreDataStackSetup](https://github.com/ottersoftware/CoreDataStackSetup).

As an added bonus (and the disclaimer will stay for now at least), Marcus very kindly reviewed the code and suggested some tweaks.

*Updated on 20 March 2015*

I've now added a Swift DatabaseManager class to the project. This should probably be considered a beta since I'm only now getting to grips with Swift. Please feel free to suggest improvments and changes to it (and the original code too).
