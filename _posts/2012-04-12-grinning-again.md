This afternoon my daughter and I picked up my new [Trek 7.3 FX](http://www.trekbikes.com/uk/en/bikes/town/recreation/fx/7_3_fx/) from [John's Bikes](http://www.johnsbikes.co.uk) in Bath.

Originally we'd had plans to go for a bit of a ride along part of [The Colliers Way](http://www.sustrans.org.uk/sustrans-near-you/south-west/easy-rides-in-the-south-west/colliers-way) from Great Elm towards Radstock. Unfortunately as we left Bath the skies darkened and it started to drizzle. By the time we got hime it was still raining so we decided to simply do a very short route through some of the lanes surrounding the village we live in. It would at least allow me to try my new bike and for my daughter to get back into the saddle after a winter off.

Now I really can't properly comment on the bike after a ride of just under two miles but I can say that the bike felt great and was much, much more comfortable than my Dawes Super Galaxy ever seemed to be. For the first time in quite a while I was able to cycle along with a big grin on my face.

I'm thoroughly looking forward to Monday when I can go for a longer ride and really get to grips with my bike.
